    <p>My portfolio site is written in HTML5 and uses CSS for styling and a mix
      of JavaScript and JQuery to power the animations on the pages.
    </p><br>
    <p>The idea of this site is to demonstrate my work and progress as a developer
      as well as being a bit of a sandbox for applying new techniques and ideas
      I'm learning.
    </p><br>
    <p>The projects page is a collection of projects I've worked on. My design
      philopsophy as been that pages shoudl be quick and interactive like an app.
      Using JavaScript and JQuery this page generates content based on the link
      the vistor selects.
    </p><br>
    <p>At the moment I'm working on adding content to the page and improving
      some of the animations - such as different versions of animation depending
      on the last page viewed in order to have a more app-like look and feel.
